# Sample D3 Dashboard

A simple React + Redux implementation. This is a sample project I'm working on to develop my skills with react and d3

This connects to a custom back end api server that I have mocked together quickly with nodal.  I'd like to publish all this to heroku at somepoint with the backend to share, but for now I have an old local data build on heroku at <d3-sample-dashboard.herokuapp.com>

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
